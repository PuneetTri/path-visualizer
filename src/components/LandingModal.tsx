          {`Thank you so much for checking out my path visualization project! It's
          a mini-project I worked on during my third year, and I drew a lot of
          inspiration from Cl√©ment Mihailescu. My passion for Data Structures and
          Algorithms (DSA) played a big role in creating this. In this project,
          I aimed to address some issues I noticed with Cl√©ment's website. I
          focused on optimizing the performance for PCs with lower specs and
          also ensured that the design is mobile-friendly. I hope you enjoy
          exploring and visualizing different paths!`}

        <p>
          Now, you can throw some challenges into the mix by adding blocks to
          the grid. Watch as the algorithm navigates through, factoring in those
          tricky blocked paths, all while aiming for the shortest route. To add
          blocks, just click or tap on a grid cell. And guess what? You can
          spice things up even more by dragging your mouse to add multiple
          blocks at once. Mobile users, don't feel left out‚Äîyou can do the same
          by swiping across the grid. Let the strategic blocking begin! üîí‚ú®

          diving into during our curriculum. My goal is that this project serves
          as a helpful guide for you too, shedding light on how these algorithms
